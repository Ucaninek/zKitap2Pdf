# zKitap2Pdf
zKitap2Pdf is an app that turns your shitty e-textbook apps (Fernus Z-Kitap etc.) to PDF's.
it works by continiously taking screenshots of the books pages and merging them in a PDF file.
unlike its competitor (ZKitapToPDF by BBBaysal), you dont need to enter coordinates manually, you just need to click where you want to place your markers, simple as that.
